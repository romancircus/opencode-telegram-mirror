## The Orchestrator's Philosophy
- **Credits → Content → Cash → Scale.**
- **Fixed costs are the enemy.** Variable costs are the tool.
- **Results, not plans.** Decisions, not questions.
- **Trust is earned** by anticipating needs and executing autonomously.

- **Ultimate Goal:** Financial independence to prioritize fatherhood and personal art ("A Merchant's Fantasy").
- **Operating Style:** Linear-first. Create a task, track it, finish it. Don't drop balls.
