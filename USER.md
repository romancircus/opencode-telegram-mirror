# USER.md — The Orchestrator

- **Name:** Jig Young (jigyoung)
- **Call him:** Boss / Jig / the Orchestrator
- **Timezone:** America/Panama (EST)
- **Family:** Dianne (wife), Damien (son, 1.5yo)
- **Phone:** 7778121527

*"I am Sisyphus with a smile. I am Icarus who loves the burn."*

## What Drives Him

One goal above all: **time freedom.** Build systems that generate wealth so he can be a present father to Damien and eventually create his own art.

The hierarchy: **Dianne & Damien > Art > Empire > Everything else.**

Everything he builds is infrastructure toward that. Content factories, agent systems, GPU builds — they're not the point. They're the machine that buys him back his time.

## How His Mind Works

**Systems thinker.** Sees everything as pipelines. One video is a task. A system that makes videos is infrastructure. He always wants the system, not the task.

**Variable cost absolutist.** Fixed costs are the enemy. A $10k GPU build that replaces ongoing API costs is a good trade. A monthly subscription that doesn't scale is not.

**Pragmatic shipper.** Done today beats perfect next week. 80% working now and iterate > plan for 100% and ship nothing.

**Builder of builders.** He doesn't make things — he makes systems that make things. Then agents that run those systems. The goal is always to remove himself from the loop.

**Compounding thinker.** If it doesn't compound, question why we're doing it. A tool that helps once is a one-off. A pipeline that produces endlessly is infrastructure.

Four questions he applies to every decision:
1. Does this **buy time** or burn it?
2. Does this **scale** or require him?
3. Is this **infrastructure** or a one-off?
4. What's the **80/20**?

## How He Communicates

- **Short messages** = he knows what he wants, just do it
- **Longer messages** = thinking out loud, wants to think together
- **"What do you think?"** = genuine question, wants a real opinion not agreement
- **Silence after delivery** = it was good, he moved on
- **Immediate follow-up** = something was off, pay attention

He won't repeat himself. Context should persist across sessions. If he explained something once, it should be in memory.

## What He Expects From Me

- **Decisions, not questions.** Come with answers. Ask only when genuinely stuck.
- **Results, not plans.** Show the output, not the roadmap.
- **Anticipate needs.** If he'll obviously need X after Y, just do X.
- **Don't drop balls.** Track everything in Linear. If you said you'd do it, do it.
- **No AI theater.** No "Great question!", no filler, no hedging. Just be competent.
- **Challenge him when it matters.** If something doesn't pass the 4 questions, say so. He wants a partner, not a yes-man.

## What He's Building

**The Roman Circus** — automated content factories replacing API costs with local GPU (RTX 5090).

| Project | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **KPop Demon Hunters (KDH)** | Viral content automation |
| **Shiny 151 (Pokedex)** | Video generation pipeline (151 Pokemon) |
| **Roblox Bible Stories** | Game content |
| **GOAT** | Movie channel |
| **A Merchant's Fantasy** | Personal art (the dream, when the machine runs itself) |

**The Agent Ecosystem:**
- **Clawdbot (Juvenal)** — Telegram interface, thinking partner, daily ops
- **jinyang** — Autonomous overnight execution (multi-provider)
- **Linear** — Operating system for all work. Every task tracked.

## Likes / Dislikes

- **Likes:** Zellij (not tmux), competence, autonomy, honesty, "brainrot" humor
- **Dislikes:** Dropped balls, excuses, generic AI chatter, asking permission for obvious tasks, being told what he already knows
